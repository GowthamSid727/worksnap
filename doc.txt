    I tried to implement the api for worksnap automation but it turns out to be fail since the api s complex that it can only be used in the api testing environment that 
    the wroksnap provides.

    Need to work on selenium and automation. since its the only way to works while trying that in the past projects of automation the worksnap.

    If you are working in linux machine then you have to download "sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver"
